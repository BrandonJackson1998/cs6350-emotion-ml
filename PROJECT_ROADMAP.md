# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the long-term development goals and tasks for the emotion detection project.

## 1. Problem Definition & Goals
- [ ] Define emotion transition detection for educational monitoring
  - Detect transitions between 7 emotional states: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
  - Focus on monitoring students' emotional states during learning sessions
- [ ] Establish success criteria and evaluation metrics
  - Primary metric: Accuracy of emotion transition detection
  - Secondary metric: Processing speed for real-time application
- [ ] Define target emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- [ ] Set performance benchmarks
  - Target accuracy: >85% for emotion classification
  - Target speed: Real-time processing capability (<100ms per frame)
  - Application: Educational technology for student engagement monitoring

## 2. Data Collection
- [ ] Download FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle
  - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013/data?select=test
  - Target: ~30,000 images for training, ~10,000 for testing
- [ ] Verify dataset contains all required emotion classes (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral)
- [ ] Document dataset characteristics and limitations
- [ ] Set up data storage structure and organization
- [ ] Validate data integrity and completeness

## 3. Data Preparation
- [ ] Clean and validate image data
- [ ] Preprocess images (resize, normalize, etc.)
- [ ] Handle missing or corrupted data
- [ ] Create train/validation/test splits
- [ ] Format data for model consumption

## 4. Feature Engineering
- [ ] Extract facial features from images
- [ ] Create temporal features from time series
- [ ] Select most informative features
- [ ] Handle feature scaling and normalization
- [ ] Create feature pipelines

## 5. Model Training
- [ ] Select appropriate ML algorithms
- [ ] Implement baseline models
- [ ] Train deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, etc.)
- [ ] Handle time series aspects of the data
- [ ] Cross-validation setup

## 6. Evaluation
- [ ] Implement evaluation metrics
- [ ] Create test harness
- [ ] Perform model validation
- [ ] Compare model performances
- [ ] Generate evaluation reports

## 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
- [ ] Define hyperparameter search space
- [ ] Implement tuning strategy (grid search, random search, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize model parameters
- [ ] Document best parameters found

## 8. Deployment
- [ ] Package model for deployment
- [ ] Create inference pipeline
- [ ] Build API or application interface
- [ ] Test deployment setup
- [ ] Create documentation for usage

## 9. Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up model drift detection
- [ ] Create update/retraining pipeline
- [ ] Plan for model versioning
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures
